4. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
None


5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
None

--Aim for no more than two sentences for each of the following questions.--


6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?



7. Did you design your app specifically for iOS or Android, or both?



8. How can a person log overnight sleep in your app? Why did you choose to support logging overnight sleep in this way?

A person can log their overnight sleep by inputting their sleep and wake time (date and time). It is done that way so the user would not have to log twice (once at night and once in the morning). They would only have to do it once after they wake up. 

9. How can a person log sleepiness during the day in your app? Why did you choose to support logging sleepiness in this way?



10. How can a person view the data they logged in your app? Why did you choose to support viewing logged data in this way?



11. Which feature choose--using a native device resource, backing up logged data, or both?

We used a native device resource.

12. If you used a native device resource, what feature did you add? How does this feature change the app's experience for a user?

The feature we added is local notifications. At 9am everyday, there will be a notif sent to the user's device to as a reminder to log their sleep data. 

13. If you backed up logged data, where does it back up to?
-


14. Did you add any "extra" features, such as other data to log, the ability to edit or delete data, or changes to the styling of the app? If so, what did you add? How do these add to the experience of the app?
